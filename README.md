# ruse-rolls
A python script to take rolls from airtable and upload them onto a todoist roll

For some reason, latest versions of serverless don't deploy properly from my development environment - it might be an issue with wsl2? Therefore, this deploys to aws with serverless@1.71.1

Did this need to be deployed? No, not really.
Did I do it anyway? Yes, I did.
